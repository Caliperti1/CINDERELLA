**Computational Intelligence w/ NCAA Data for Evaluating Rankings and Learning &amp; Locating Anomalies (March Madness Pipeline)**

## Overall Approach 
The model was a big succeess last year but we're abck with some new strategies! 

The current method in this program is to train an ensamble of models based on per game stats of each team weighted by their strength of schedule. We then 'simulate' the tournament by predcitng a winner in each head to head matchup. We use a monte carlo simualtion to run our tounrnament simulation multiple times, each game randomly selecting which model will be used to predict a winner. 

## Data Source
